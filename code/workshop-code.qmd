In this workshop, we will answer the question: How do specific leaf area, water treatment, and species influence plant mass?  

**Specific leaf area** is a continuous variable measured in cm^2^/g.  

**Water treatment** is a categorical variable (i.e. a *factor*) with 2 levels: drought stressed (DS) and well watered (WW).  

**Species** is a categorical variable (again, a *factor*) with 6 levels.  

| Species name                 | Species code | Common name        |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| _Encelia californica_        | ENCCAL       | Bush sunflower     |  
| _Eschscholzia californica_   | ESCCAL       | California poppy   | 
| _Penstemon centranthifolius_ | PENCEN       | Scarlet bugler     | 
| _Grindelia camporums_        | GRINCAM      | Gumweed            | 
| _Salvia leucophylla_         | SALLEU       | Purple sage        | 
| _Stipa pulchra_              | STIPUL       | Purple needlegrass | 
| _Lotus scoparius_            | LOTSCO       | Deerweed           |

Insert code to display 10 random rows from the data frame here.  





# 3. Visualizing data

## What is the relationship between SLA and plant mass?  

Make a scatterplot to visualize SLA (the predictor) on the x-axis, and total mass (the response) on the y-axis.  

Label the axes with units where appropriate.  

Add a title describing the relationship (e.g. as SLA increases, total mass ______). 





## What are the differences in total mass between water treatments?

Make a jitterplot to visualize the differences in plant mass between water treatments.  

Label the axes with units where appropriate.  

Add a title describing the differences in (mean or median) plant mass between water treatments.







## What are the differences in total mass between species?

Make a jitterplot to visualize the differences in plant mass between species.  

Label the axes with units where appropriate.  

Add a title describing the differences in (mean or median) plant mass between species.  

Bonus: order the x-axis by decreasing mean plant mass _and_ wrap the long species names using the `label_wrap()` function from the `scales` package.








# 4. Fitting models

8 models total:

| Model number | SLA | Water treatment | Species | Predictor list              |  
|--------------|:---:|:---------------:|:-------:|:---------------------------:|  
| 0            |     |                 |         | no predictors (null model)  |
| 1            |  X  |       X         |    X    | all predictors (full model) | 
| 2            |  X  |       X         |         | SLA and water treatment     |   
| 3            |  X  |                 |    X    | SLA and species             |    
| 4            |     |       X         |    X    | water treatment and species |    
| 5            |  X  |                 |         | SLA                         |    
| 6            |     |       X         |         | water treatment             |    
| 7            |     |                 |    X    | species                     |

## Model fitting

```{r}
#| label: model fitting

# model 0: null model


# model 1: all predictors


# model 2: SLA and water treatment


# model 3: SLA and species


# model 4: water treatment and species


# model 5: SLA


# model 6: water treatment


# model 7: species

```

## Model selection

Insert code to use the `AICc()` function to calculate the AIC for each model.  

Arrange by decreasing AIC.




## Model diagnostics

Insert code to look at the diagnostic plots for the best model.





## Summary

Insert code to display the summary for the best model. 



**What are the reference levels?**  



**What does the `(Intercept)` represent?**  



**What does `water_treatmentWell watered` represent?**



**What does `species_namePenstemon centranthifolius` represent?**  



**What does `species_nameEschscholzia californica` represent?**




## Stop and think: what does this model mean?  

**What is the best model?**

[insert your response here]

**How much variation in the response (total mass, in grams) does this model explain?**

[insert your response here]

**How do we interpret the effects of the predictors on the response variable (again, total mass in grams)?**

[insert your response here]

# 4. Model predictions

Insert code to generate model predictions for the best model.  

Rename the `x` column and `group` column to match the original data frame (`drought_exp_clean`).

Look at the object before plotting.



# 5. Final figure

Create a clean, publication ready figure depicting predictions for the best model and the underlying data.
